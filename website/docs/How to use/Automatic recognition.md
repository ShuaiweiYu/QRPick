# Automatic Full-Screen Recognition

Want to scan even faster? QR Pick can analyze your entire display at once.

### Usage
- Select **Quick Full Scan** from the Menu Bar icon.
- The app takes a silent snapshot of your entire screen and searches for codes.

### Handling Multiple Codes
If the app detects more than one QR code:
1. It will notify you that multiple sources were found.
2. It will suggest switching to **Manual Recognition** so you can pick the specific one you need.

*This prevents the wrong link from opening accidentally.*
