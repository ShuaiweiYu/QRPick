# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get QR Pick running on your Mac.

### 1. Download
Get the latest `.zip` or `.dmg` from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ShuaiweiYu/QRPick/releases).

### 2. Move to Applications
Extract the file and drag **QR Pick.app** into your `/Applications` folder.

### 3. Security & Privacy (Required)
Because QR Pick is currently independently published, you need to manually trust the app:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. You will see a message: *"QR Pick was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer."*
4. Click **Open Anyway**.

### 4. Permissions
On first launch, the app will request:
- **Screen Recording**: This is essential for the app to "see" the QR codes on your display.
- *Note: We do not record or save your screen. Each frame is processed in memory and destroyed immediately.*
