# QR Pick v1.1.0

We are excited to introduce **QR Pick** (formerly MacQRScanner). This version focuses on speed and accessibility, making it easier than ever to capture data from your screen.

### 🚀 New Features
- **Global Hotkey Support**: You can now trigger the area scanner instantly from any application using `Command (⌘) + Shift + R`.
- **The "QR Pick" Identity**: We have officially rebranded! The new name reflects our goal: to let you "pick" information off your screen as easily as clicking a button.

### 🛠 Improvements & Fixes
- **Enhanced Vision Logic**: Optimized the barcode detection request to reduce CPU overhead during scans.
- **Smart Window Management**: Result windows now automatically bring themselves to the front and close after performing primary actions (like opening a URL).
