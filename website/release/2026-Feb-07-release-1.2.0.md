# QR Pick v1.2.0: Faster, Simpler, Smarter

This update officially introduces **QR Pick** to the world and brings the highly requested "Quick Full Scan" feature to your desktop.

### 🚀 Key Highlights

#### 1. Hello, QR Pick!
We’ve said goodbye to "MacQRScanner" and embraced a new identity: **QR Pick**. The name represents our goal—to let you "pick" information off your screen as easily as picking up a coin.

#### 2. Quick Full Scan
Tired of selecting areas? Now you can scan your entire screen with a single click.
- **Auto-Detection**: The app automatically crawls your current display to find any valid QR or Barcode.
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: When multiple codes are found, QR Pick won't guess. It will ask you to use the "Area Scan" for precise targeting, preventing accidental link openings.

### 🛠 Improvements
- **Performance Boost**: Optimized the temporary image processing logic, reducing scan latency by approximately 30%.
- **Updated UI**: All dialogs and menus have been updated with the new branding and refined iconography.

### 📥 Download
Head over to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ShuaiweiYu/QRPick/releases) page to download the latest `QR-Pick-v1.2.0.zip`.

> **Note**: Since the app is not Apple-certified, please right-click the app in Finder and select "Open" to bypass the initial security warning. Ensure "Screen Recording" permission is enabled in System Settings.
