# QR Pick v1.0.0: First Release

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of **QR Pick** (v1.0.0)! 🥳

QR Pick was born out of a simple need: a fast, lightweight, and privacy-respecting way to scan QR codes and barcodes directly from a Mac screen without having to reach for a smartphone.

### 🌟 Key Features in this Initial Release

- **Precision Area Scanning**: Use the native macOS selection tool to pick any QR/Bar code on your screen.
- **Smart Data Parsing**:
    - **WiFi**: Instantly extracts SSIDs and passwords.
    - **URLs**: Recognizes web links for one-click browsing.
    - **Email**: Parses `mailto` and `MATMSG` formats for quick communication.
    - **Text**: Handles plain text for easy clipboard copying.
- **100% Local & Private**: No data ever leaves your machine. The app works entirely offline.
- **Minimalist UI**: A clean, SwiftUI-powered interface that stays out of your way until you need it.

### 🛡 Privacy Commitment
From day one, QR Pick is designed to be a "Zero-Trust" utility. It requires Screen Recording permissions to "see" the codes, but it does not store images, record video, or connect to any remote servers. **What you scan stays with you.**

### 📥 Getting Started
1. Download the `QR-Pick-v1.0.0.zip` from the Assets below.
2. Move it to your `/Applications` folder.
3. Grant the necessary **Screen Recording** permissions in System Settings.
