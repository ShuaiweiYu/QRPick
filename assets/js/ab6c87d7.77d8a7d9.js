Hello, QR Pick!\\nWe\u2019ve said goodbye to \\"MacQRScanner\\" and embraced a new identity: **QR Pick**.

Now you can scan your entire screen with a single click.\\n- **Auto-Detection**: The app automatically crawls your current display to find any valid QR or Barcode.\\n- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: When multiple codes are found, QR Pick won\'t guess. It will ask you to use the \\"Area Scan\\" for precise targeting, preventing accidental link openings.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udee0 Improvements\\n- **Performance Boost**: Optimized the temporary image processing logic, reducing scan latency by approximately 30%.\\n- **Updated UI**: All dialogs and menus have been updated with the new branding and refined iconography.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udce5 Download\\nHead over to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ShuaiweiYu/QRPick/releases) page to download the latest `QR-Pick-v1.2.0.zip`.\\n\\n> **Note**: Since the app is not Apple-certified, please right-click the app in Finder and select \\"Open\\" to bypass the initial security warning.
